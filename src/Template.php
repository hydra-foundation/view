/**
 * One render in progress: the `$this` a template file sees.
 *
 * Holds the state a single inheritance chain needs — captured sections and the
 * pending layout — so it is isolated per render(). Templates call its methods:
 * extends() to wrap in a layout, start()/stop() to capture a named section,
 * section() to yield one, e() to escape, and partial() to nest another view.
 *
 * Inheritance is resolved by output buffering, not compilation: the child runs
 * first into a buffer, extends() merely records the parent, and the child's
 * leftover output becomes the implicit "content" section. The layout is then
 * rendered with those sections available — the inverse of how it reads, which
 * is exactly what a compiling engine like Twig does under the hood.
